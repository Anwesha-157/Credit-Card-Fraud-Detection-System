This project develops a web-based Credit Card Fraud Detection System using unsupervised machine learning. The dataset is taken from U.S. Government Purchase Card (P-Card) transactions, which is raw and unlabeled. Fraud detection is achieved through anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest, where suspicious transactions are flagged without requiring predefined fraud labels. The system is implemented as a full-stack web application using Flask, with a user-friendly interface for uploading CSV datasets, step-by-step processing (Preprocessing → EDA → Fraud Detection), visualizations of transaction distribution and fraud-prone agencies, fraud summary report (total vs. fraud percentage), and downloadable fraud report (CSV). Additionally, the system integrates an admin login and dashboard feature, making the prototype closer to a deployable professional solution.
